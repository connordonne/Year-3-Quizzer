        "question": "What is systems programming?",
        "answer": "Writing software that serves other software (e.g. OS, drivers)."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why use systems programming languages?",
        "answer": "Fine-grained control over program execution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are common performance constraints for system software?",
        "answer": "Fast execution time, low memory consumption, low energy usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does C program compilation work?",
        "answer": "1. Preprocessor: Expands macros like #include and #define. 2. Compiler: Converts code to assembly, then to machine code (object file). 3. Linker: Combines object files, checks for missing functions (e.g. printf)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the linker's role?",
        "answer": "Combines object files into one executable. Ensures all functions are correctly linked to their machine code."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the main function in C?",
        "answer": "The entry point of every C program. Returns 0 on success."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is the main function written?",
        "answer": "Two forms: int main() and int main(int argc, char* argv[]) for handling command line arguments."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does printf do?",
        "answer": "Outputs formatted text. Specifiers like %d, %s substitute values."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are variables defined in C?",
        "answer": "Declared with data types (e.g. int x = 4;). C is statically typed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do we need data types?",
        "answer": "They give meaning to bits and define how values are stored and interpreted."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do data types play?",
        "answer": "Data types ensure meaningful operations; compiler checks for type errors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are variables stored in memory?",
        "answer": "Stored at fixed locations. Data types affect memory usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the typical sizes of data types?",
        "answer": "Common sizes: char = 1 byte, int = 4 bytes, float = 4 bytes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are Boolean values in C?",
        "answer": "0 is false, non-zero is true. Use <stdbool.h> for true/false macros."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is lexical scoping?",
        "answer": "Variables are unique within a scope. Inner scopes can shadow outer scopes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the lifetime of a variable?",
        "answer": "Depends on allocation: 1) automatic (local), 2) static (global), or 3) allocated (programmer chooses)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is stack-based memory management?",
        "answer": "Stack memory is used for local variables, managed automatically."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the heap?",
        "answer": "The heap is memory manually managed by the programmer."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are arrays handled in C?",
        "answer": "Arrays store elements of the same type, fixed size on stack, dynamic on heap."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are structs?",
        "answer": "Collections of variables of different types, accessed like class members."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are strings represented in C?",
        "answer": "Arrays of characters, terminated by \\0. Printed with %s."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are functions defined in C?",
        "answer": "Return type, name, parameters, body. Same as Java :)"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is call-by-value?",
        "answer": "Arguments are copied when passed to functions. Changes don’t affect originals."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are structs and arrays passed to functions?",
        "answer": "Structs by value; arrays by reference (first element’s address)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'byte addressable memory'?",
        "answer": "Each byte in memory has its own address. In a 64-bit architecture, addresses are 64 bits (or 8 bytes) long."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a pointer in C programming?",
        "answer": "A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'address-of' operator (&) do?",
        "answer": "It gives the memory address of a variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the 'dereference' operator (*)?",
        "answer": "It accesses the value at the address held by a pointer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is memory management important for energy efficiency?",
        "answer": "Efficient use of memory reduces data transfer and energy consumption, as memory access and movement use considerable system energy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a pointer is set to NULL?",
        "answer": "NULL represents 'no address' or 'nothing' and is used when a pointer has no valid address."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does malloc do?",
        "answer": "malloc allocates a specified number of bytes in heap memory and returns a pointer to the first byte of this block."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does free do, and why should you use it?",
        "answer": "free deallocates memory previously allocated on the heap, preventing memory leaks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a memory leak?",
        "answer": "A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not freed, leading to wasted memory resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between stack and heap memory?",
        "answer": "Stack memory is automatically managed and used for fixed-size variables, while heap memory is manually managed and used for dynamically-sized allocations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is void * in C?",
        "answer": "void * is a generic pointer type in C that can hold any pointer type but cannot be dereferenced directly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are pointers and arrays related?",
        "answer": "The name of an array refers to the address of its first element, making it similar to a pointer to the array’s start."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is pointer arithmetic?",
        "answer": "Pointer arithmetic involves adding or subtracting integer values to pointers, moving the pointer by the size of the data type it points to."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the risk of returning a pointer to a local variable?",
        "answer": "The pointer might outlive the variable, pointing to an invalid address after the variable’s lifetime ends."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you declare a pointer that points to a constant?",
        "answer": "Use const to declare constant pointers: float * const ptr; (pointer address is constant), const float * ptr; (value pointed to is constant), or const float * const ptr; (both address and value are constant)."
    }
