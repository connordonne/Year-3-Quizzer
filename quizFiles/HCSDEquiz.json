        "question": "What is the definition of consistency (in the context of HCI)?",
        "answer": "Using the same design elements across an application to avoid user confusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is consistency important?",
        "answer": "Users rely on visual and interaction cues to navigate applications without guessing. Inconsistent interfaces lead to confusion and frustration, forcing users to adapt, guess, or make costly tech support calls. Consistent design makes applications easier to learn and use, increasing satisfaction and usability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of consistency for users?",
        "answer": "Consistency helps users understand and interact with the application efficiently. Inconsistent design elements can cause confusion, making the interface harder to learn."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of consistency?",
        "answer": "Internal: Design remains the same within the application, across different screens and features. External: Design aligns with other applications the user may be familiar with."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you establish consistency?",
        "answer": "Set expectations with familiar elements. User expectations are influenced by what they’ve seen in other apps and past experiences. User-centred design (contextual inquiry, prototype testing) can help define consistent patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is good application design?",
        "answer": "Successful designs meet business goals and user expectations. Consistency reduces cognitive load ('Don’t make me think' principle)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you have consistency in elements?",
        "answer": "Layout: Place similar elements in the same location on every screen. Typography: Apply a standard set of fonts and sizes to indicate importance. Colour: Use a defined colour palette to emphasize hierarchy and group related items. Imagery: Use a unified style for charts, logos, and icons. Icons should be easily recognizable or accompanied by text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is visual hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Visual hierarchy refers to the perception of the relative importance of objects on a screen, guiding users on what to focus on and how to interact with it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What affects visual hierarchy in application design?",
        "answer": "Factors include position, size, colour, interface control type (e.g., button vs link), and relationships between elements. Consistency is key to effective design."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is hierarchy applied in design?",
        "answer": "By decisions on where to place elements, how large they should be, what colours to use, and how to represent their behaviour based on importance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if there is no hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Without hierarchy, objects attract the eye equally, leading to confusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does hierarchy relate to rank systems?",
        "answer": "Just like ranks in military or martial arts, interface elements need a visual ranking system to signify their importance and role."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the characteristics of hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Elements with more visual weight or prominence appear more important. Contrast, position, and proximity are key factors."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does contrast influence hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Contrast helps make something stand out by creating visible differences between elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does position affect hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Placement on the screen, proximity to other elements, and grouping can all influence visual prominence and perception of hierarchy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do size, colour, and ornament affect hierarchy?",
        "answer": "Larger elements appear more important. Darker and warmer colours (red, yellow) have more visual weight. Ornament and finish can indicate importance but should be used sparingly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is layout in visual usability?",
        "answer": "Layout involves positioning elements on a screen to create a structure that people can understand, supporting use, behaviour, and aesthetics in the design process."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the meta-principles of layout?",
        "answer": "Consistency, hierarchy, and personality affect layout, and layout, in turn, reinforces them. Successful layouts clarify information and the app's personality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the language of layout?",
        "answer": "Basic layout terms include alignment, proximity, grid, scale, and white space. Specific terms for screens include screen size and templates, including responsiveness."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does screen size affect layout?",
        "answer": "The screen acts as a frame for content, and layout principles need to consider different screen sizes and formats to ensure consistency and usability."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does position influence layout?",
        "answer": "Positioning elements creates visual relationships that help users make sense of content. However, improper alignment can lead to confusion (e.g., USDA’s SuperTracker)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is white space, and why is it important?",
        "answer": "White space provides a resting point for the eye and helps to organize elements. It makes screens more approachable and helps create clarity in dense layouts."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do proximity, scale, and alignment affect layout?",
        "answer": "Proximity shows relationships between elements. Scale shows importance. Alignment organizes layouts and establishes relationships between elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role does a grid play in layout?",
        "answer": "A grid provides an underlying structure for placement, alignment, and size. It helps guide the eye and organize content. Grids are optional, but alignment is crucial."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are templates, and how are they used?",
        "answer": "Templates provide consistent margins and placement rules for types of content. They enforce internal consistency but may limit design creativity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of colour in HCI?",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of designing an experiment in HCI research?",
        "answer": "To enhance the signal by reducing noise through carefully designing the setup, manipulating variables, and choosing appropriate procedures, tasks, and participants."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is having a sound methodology critical in HCI experiments?",
        "answer": "A sound methodology ensures scientific rigor and allows researchers to make sense of the 'signal' in a noisy world by making deliberate decisions about variables, tasks, participants, and data analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do the APA guidelines play in HCI research?",
        "answer": "APA guidelines help researchers structure their methodology, define variables, recruit participants, report statistical results, and ensure the research process is standardized and replicable."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is ethics approval, and why is it important in HCI research?",
        "answer": "Ethics approval ensures the safety, dignity, and welfare of participants and must be obtained from institutional boards to confirm the experiment meets ethical standards, especially regarding informed consent and participant rights."
    },
    {
        "question": "What must participants be informed about?",
        "answer": "Participants must be informed about the nature of the research, methodology, risks, benefits, their right to withdraw without penalty, and their right to anonymity and confidentiality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are independent and dependent variables in HCI experiments?",
        "answer": "The independent variable is manipulated by the researcher, such as an interface or interaction technique, while the dependent variable is the measurable outcome that depends on participant behavior, like task completion time or accuracy."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a confounding variable?",
        "answer": "A confounding variable systematically changes with the independent variable, making it unclear whether the observed effects are due to the independent variable or the confound."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can researchers avoid confounding variables in HCI experiments?",
        "answer": "Researchers should eliminate or account for confounding variables, such as using the same equipment for all test conditions to avoid bias."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are control and random variables, and how do they affect experiment outcomes?",
        "answer": "Control variables are kept constant to avoid influencing the dependent variable, while random variables are allowed to vary freely, which increases generalizability but can introduce more variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between within-subjects and between-subjects experimental designs?",
        "answer": "In within-subjects designs, all participants experience all conditions, while in between-subjects designs, different groups of participants are tested on different conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the pros and cons of using a within-subjects design versus a between-subjects design in experiments?",
        "answer": "Within-subjects designs require fewer participants and minimize variance as participants act as their own control, but may introduce interference or learning effects. Between-subjects designs require more participants, avoid interference, but require careful balancing of participant groups."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are order effects?",
        "answer": "Order effects occur when the sequence of conditions influences performance, such as through learning or fatigue."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is counterbalancing, and why is it important in within-subjects design?",
        "answer": "Counterbalancing is a method of varying the order of conditions for participants to reduce practice or fatigue effects, ensuring the order in which conditions are presented does not bias results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is sample size important in HCI experiments, and how do researchers determine the right number of participants?",
        "answer": "Sample size impacts the likelihood of obtaining statistically significant results. Researchers often use a similar number of participants to previous studies to ensure statistical power without overinflating sample size."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of pilot testing in HCI experiments?",
        "answer": "Pilot testing ensures that the experimental setup, tasks, and data collection methods work as intended and that the collected data is valid for analysis."

    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two types of rating scales used in closed-ended questions?",
        "answer": "Unipolar scales, which range from zero to an extreme amount, and bipolar scales, which range from an extreme negative to an extreme positive with a natural midpoint."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is satisficing in survey responses?",
        "answer": "Satisficing occurs when respondents use minimal cognitive effort to answer questions, choosing a satisfactory answer without fully considering the question, which can lead to suboptimal or random responses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is acquiescence bias, and how can it be minimised?",
        "answer": "Acquiescence bias is the tendency of respondents to agree with statements regardless of their content. It can be minimised by avoiding yes/no or agree/disagree questions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is social desirability bias, and what types of questions are most susceptible to it?",
        "answer": "Social desirability bias occurs when respondents answer questions in a way they think will be viewed positively by others. Sensitive topics like voting behaviour, illegal acts, or sexual activity are most susceptible."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is response order bias, and how can it be minimised?",
        "answer": "Response order bias is the tendency for respondents to favour options at the beginning or end of a list. It can be minimised by randomising answer options or alternating the order of scales between respondents."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does order bias affect survey responses?",
        "answer": "Order bias occurs when earlier questions influence the responses to later ones, often by priming the respondent’s thoughts in a certain direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are double-barrelled questions, and why should they be avoided?",
        "answer": "Double-barrelled questions ask about more than one item while only allowing for a single response. They should be avoided as they force respondents to give a single answer for multiple constructs, leading to less reliable data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why are recall and prediction questions problematic in surveys?",
        "answer": "Respondents may struggle to accurately remember past behaviours or attitudes, leading to recall bias. Additionally, people often cannot accurately predict future behaviours or attitudes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a leading question, and why is it considered biased?",
        "answer": "A leading question suggests a particular answer or includes information that biases the respondent, manipulating the respondent’s answer to align with the researcher’s expectations."
