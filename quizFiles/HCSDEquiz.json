    },
    {
        "question": "How do you establish consistency?",
        "answer": "Set expectations with familiar elements. User expectations are influenced by what they’ve seen in other apps and past experiences. User-centred design (contextual inquiry, prototype testing) can help define consistent patterns."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is good application design?",
        "answer": "Successful designs meet business goals and user expectations. Consistency reduces cognitive load ('Don’t make me think' principle)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you have consistency in elements?",
        "answer": "Layout: Place similar elements in the same location on every screen. Typography: Apply a standard set of fonts and sizes to indicate importance. Colour: Use a defined colour palette to emphasize hierarchy and group related items. Imagery: Use a unified style for charts, logos, and icons. Icons should be easily recognizable or accompanied by text."
    },
    {

    },
    {
        "question": "What is a confounding variable?",
        "answer": "A confounding variable systematically changes with the independent variable, making it unclear whether the observed effects are due to the independent variable or the confound."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can researchers avoid confounding variables in HCI experiments?",
        "answer": "Researchers should eliminate or account for confounding variables, such as using the same equipment for all test conditions to avoid bias."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are control and random variables, and how do they affect experiment outcomes?",
        "answer": "Control variables are kept constant to avoid influencing the dependent variable, while random variables are allowed to vary freely, which increases generalizability but can introduce more variability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between within-subjects and between-subjects experimental designs?",
        "answer": "In within-subjects designs, all participants experience all conditions, while in between-subjects designs, different groups of participants are tested on different conditions."

        "question": "What is the role of consistency in design?",
        "answer": "Consistency helps users transfer knowledge from one product to another, making interactions intuitive and reducing confusion."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why might users resist changes in design conventions?",
        "answer": "Users may resist changes because they are familiar with existing conventions, and learning a new system can be challenging."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key consideration when deciding whether to change a design convention?",
        "answer": "The key consideration is whether the new design offers significant improvement. If the benefits outweigh the difficulties, the change is justified."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can design use constraints to guide user behaviour?",
        "answer": "Constraints limit possible actions, guiding users towards correct usage and preventing errors. They can be physical, cultural, or logical."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is feedback in design, and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Feedback provides information about the action taken and its result, helping users understand the effects of their actions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do mixed systems of design conventions often cause confusion?",
        "answer": "Mixed systems create inconsistency, making it hard for users to know which rules to follow, leading to errors and frustration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of using design constraints based on cultural conventions?",
        "answer": "Design constraints based on cultural conventions make products more intuitive by aligning with shared knowledge."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why should designers focus on user needs and behaviours when creating constraints and forcing functions?",
        "answer": "Focusing on user needs ensures that constraints and forcing functions support user goals without creating unnecessary obstacles."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'anti-affordance' in design?",
        "answer": "Anti-affordance refers to features that prevent certain actions, guiding users away from undesired behaviours."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can knowledge be stored in the world rather than in the head?",
        "answer": "Knowledge in the world involves external cues like labels or icons that help users know what to do without needing to remember."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the trade-off between knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head?",
        "answer": "Relying on knowledge in the head is efficient but error-prone, while knowledge in the world eases tasks but can clutter the interface. Good design balances both."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the types of constraints used in design?",
        "answer": "The types of constraints in design include: Physical Constraints, which limit actions through physical properties (e.g., a plug that only fits one way); Cultural Constraints, which guide actions based on learned behaviours (e.g., red lights mean stop); Semantic Constraints, which use the meaning of elements to guide behaviour (e.g., a question mark icon for help); and Logical Constraints, which rely on reasoning to determine the correct action (e.g., greyed-out options that cannot be selected)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Fitts' Law, and how does it apply to design?",
        "answer": "Fitts' Law predicts the time required to move to a target based on its size and distance. In design, it means that larger, closer targets (like big buttons or corner icons) are easier and faster to interact with."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the design implications of Fitts' Law?",
        "answer": "Design should position frequently used elements closer to the user's focus and make interactive targets larger to improve usability. For instance, placing important buttons at screen edges makes them easier to access."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'social translucence' in HCI?",
        "answer": "Social translucence refers to design features that give users awareness of others' actions and intentions in a shared environment, enhancing collaboration and communication. For example, typing indicators in a chat interface."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are 'slips' and 'mistakes' in user errors?",
        "answer": "Slips are errors where the user intends the correct action but performs it incorrectly (e.g., pressing the wrong button by accident). Mistakes occur when the user's intention is incorrect due to a misunderstanding (e.g., pulling a door that should be pushed)."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can design help minimise errors?",
        "answer": "Good design minimises errors by anticipating common mistakes, providing clear feedback, and allowing users to easily reverse actions or correct errors."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it important to consider both ease of use and error prevention in design?",
        "answer": "Balancing ease of use with error prevention ensures users can interact with the product smoothly without being hindered by excessive safety features, which can reduce usability."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the issue with mixed systems of design conventions?",
        "answer": "Mixed systems create confusion because users struggle to understand which set of rules or conventions to follow, leading to inconsistent experiences and more user errors."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of binding content to screen edges or corners?",
        "answer": "Binding content like menus or buttons to screen edges or corners helps prevent users from overshooting the target, making selection easier and quicker as these areas act as targets of infinite size in pointer-based interfaces."
