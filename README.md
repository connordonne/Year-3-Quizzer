Original program by @VaradK62442, questions made by me.

You can specify command line arguments when running the program to specify which portion of questions to use, i.e. ```python main.py 0 50``` will select half of the questions in the file you specify, ```python main.py 0 25``` will select one quarter, etc.

You may need to download the ```scikit``` module, which can be done by running ```pip install scikit-learn```.

Disclaimer:
I have made every effort to cover all relevant points of the courses in these notes. However, some information may be irrelevant, while other important details may be missing, for example in HCSDE, which involves extensive required reading materials.

These quizzes should not be considered a comprehensive set of everything you need to know for exams. To ensure you have a complete understanding of the course material, refer to the lectures and required readings to fill in any gaps or clarify any unclear points.
